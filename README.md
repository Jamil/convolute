# /Convolute/
### A web-based Discrete-Time Convolution Demo.

Signals and Systems can be fun; but unless you fully understand what the 
convolution is, things can be quite frustrating!  This is a web-app I made
in hopes to help those who are confused about convolutions but giving them 
a more intuitive understanding of what it is, how it's values are derived,
and hopefully just how interesting it can be.

### Credits and Thanks:

This web-app's HTML framework is based on Evan Wallace's Web-GL Filters app.
I did not think one would be capable of achieving such elegance in  web-apps
before stumbling upon the works of Evan Wallace.  He is an inspiration.

The editor I used is the ACE editor. You can find them here: http://ace.c9.io/
